# Russian-Peasant-Multiplication-MIPS

This is an implementation of Russian Peasant Multiplication in the MIPS Assembly Language

Russian Peasant Multiplication explained here: http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.peasant.html

This program is heavily commented because it is in assembly and therefore nearly impossible for humans to read :)
